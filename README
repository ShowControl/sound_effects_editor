The program sound_effects_editor is distributed
using the Autotools package.  See the INSTALL file
for details.  The package uses AM_MAINTAINER_MODE,
so if you update the package to use a later
version of the Autotools software, you will need
to use --enable-maintainer-mode when running
the configure script.

The program sound_effects_editor was written by 
John Sauter starting in late 2017 in support of
the ShowControl project.
